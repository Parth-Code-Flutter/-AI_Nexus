AI coding agents are evolving fast. We tested the big three to find out which one actually writes production-ready code.

# The Quick Verdict

*   🏆 **Best Overall: Cursor AI.** It's a VS Code fork, meaning it fits into your existing workflow seamlessly. The "Composer" feature is unmatched.
*   🚀 **Best for Founders: Lovable.** If you need to build a web app from scratch in minutes without touching a terminal, this is it.
*   ⚡ **Best for Experiments: Bolt.new.** Instant browser-based deployment. Perfect for prototyping.

# 1. Cursor AI: The Developer's Superpower

**Price:** Free / Pro ($20/mo)

Cursor is not just a plugin; it's a complete fork of VS Code. This allows it to index your entire codebase and understand context in a way Copilot never could.

### Killer Feature: "Composer" (Cmd+I)

You can hit `Cmd+I` and type "Refactor this entire component to use Typescript and fix the API calls," and it will edit multiple files simultaneously. It feels like pair programming with a senior engineer.

**Pros:**
*   Familiar VS Code interface
*   Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Best for coding)
*   Privacy mode (Local)

**Cons:**
*   Requires installation
*   Can hallucinate on large files

# 2. Lovable: Text-to-App Magic

**Price:** Free / Pro

Lovable is built for speed. You don't write code; you describe a product. "Make a CRM for dog walkers." Boom. It builds the database, the UI, and the authentication.

For founders who want to validate an idea over a weekend, traditional coding (even with Cursor) is too slow. Lovable is the solution.

# 3. Bolt.new: The Browser Warrior

**Price:** Free (StackBlitz)

Bolt runs entirely in your browser using WebContainers. It allows you to run Node.js servers, install npm packages, and deploy to Netlify—all without leaving Chrome.
